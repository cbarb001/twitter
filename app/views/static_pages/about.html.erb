		Twitello is a social media web site, where users can sign up and make posts. These posts, which appear on the user’s home page, can either be text or an image with text. Also, on the home page a user can see how many people are following his page and how many people he is following. The user can also click on the user’s tab where he will be taken to a page that lists all of the users. After clicking on the other user’s name, he will be taken to the other users' profiles. On this page, he will be able to view the other users' posts, follow or unfollow that user, and be able to view who the user is following or who follows that user.
